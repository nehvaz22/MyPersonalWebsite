        <h1>Welcome to Neha Vazarkar's Website!</h1>
        <h2>Climate Change: A Cause I Care About</h2>
        <p>Climate change is a severe phenomenon that has the potential to affect people around the world, especially those living in <mark>underprivileged and poorer</mark> regions. As someone lucky enough to live in New Jersey, I am passionate about spreading <b>climate change awareness and education</b> throughout the developing world to ensure that societies will have adequate resources to combat climate challenges.</p><br>
        <h2>What I Have Done to Help:</h2>
        <p>One of the ways I have helped out is by joining the organization Care About Climate. I joined as a <em>financial and grant writing intern</em> in November 2020, writing three successful grants that funded over <mark><b>$20,000</b></mark> for climate change and sustainability education for <strong>women and minorities</strong> in the developing world. In March, I became the <b>program director of the Climate Sign</b>, which is a program which aims to create a global sign for climate change (similar in idea to the peace sign.) The climate sign is formed as a hand curved into a <em>C</em>, and was featured on the <b><em>Eiffel Tower</em></b> a few years ago! My work so far has been creating the website through Squarespace and coming up with a marketing plan.</p>
