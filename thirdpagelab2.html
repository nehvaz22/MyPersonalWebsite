        <h1>EXTRA INFORMATION ABOUT ME!!</h1>
        <p class= "box">Here are some other activities I am passionate about that are worth knowing about
            <strong>me</strong>!</p>
        <li class = "box">Model UN: I have been part of Model UN since my freshman year and I enjoy researching and working together with students from across the Northeast to strategize solutions to complex global topics. Model UN definitely hasn't been the same since most competitions have gone virtual, but I had a lot of fun running the Wednesday club as co-president last year.</li>
        <li class = "box">Entrepreneurship Club: This is another one of my favorite school activities. I loved submitting various medical/healthcare innovations to different entrepreneurship competitions. When I ran the club last year with one of my friends, we also created an entrepreneurship competition for Bergen County middle schoolers, which was super fun!</li>
